# Prompt Engineering & Multi-Agent Systems Workshop

This document outlines the two-day training on prompt design and MAS architecture.

## Overview
- **Duration:** 2 days (about 6.5h each)
- **Audience:** product managers, ML/LLM engineers and domain experts
- **Goal:** design high quality prompts and build cost-efficient multi-agent systems applying the Principle of Confluence.

## Exercises in Detail
1. **Prompt Clinic** – rewrite a flawed customer-support prompt and compare the output using GPT‑4.1.
2. **Meta-Prompt Builder** – turn a user story into a reusable prompt generator and validate its consistency.
3. **Supervisor/Worker Blueprint** – implement a minimal LangGraph with caching and measure token savings.
4. **Capstone** – build a prototype that recommends BUY/HOLD/SELL with a cost vs accuracy score.

## Facilitation Tips
- Keep lecture blocks short and interleave demos.
- Use live polls to verify comprehension.
- Provide API keys in advance to save setup time.
- Offer one-on-one coaching during hacks.
